# Brick Breaker - Shop Balls

Simple browser game: buy balls in the shop, release them to break bricks and earn money.

How to run
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (double-click or serve with a static server).

Controls
- Click "Buy Ball" to buy a ball (cost increases slightly each purchase).
- Click "Release Balls" to launch all owned balls into the playfield.
- Click the canvas to launch a single free test ball.
- Shortcuts: `b` = buy ball, `r` = release, `n` = refill bricks.

Notes
- This is intentionally minimal. You can expand the game by adding multiple brick types, ball upgrades, persistent money, or levels.
